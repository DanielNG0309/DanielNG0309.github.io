title: ARBox - Augmented Reality Sandbox
description:  An interactive sandbox system that visualizes topographic elevation using time-of-flight sensors and real-time image processing. Designed as a learning platform for geography and terrain analysis, ARBox overlays depth-based contour maps onto a sandbox surface using a Raspberry Pi and OpenCV. I led technical development and system integration, selecting the hardware stack and pivoting the architecture to simplify sensor fusion and improve reliability in educational environments.
skills: 
  - Embedded Linux (Raspberry Pi 4)
  - ToF sensor
  - Real-time image processing (OpenCV, Python)
  - Contour interpolation & visualization
  - Technical leadership and rapid prototyping
