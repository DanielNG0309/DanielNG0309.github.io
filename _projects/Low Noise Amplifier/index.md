title: Wideband Low-Noise Amplifier - LTspice Design Project
description: A 3-stage bandpass amplifier design built for low noise, high fidelity, and wide bandwidth (20 Hz â€“ 20 kHz). Designed and optimized in LTspice with detailed performance validation against distortion, power, and gain criteria.
skills:
  - LTspice simulation
  - Analog signal chain design
  - Sallen-Key & BPF filtering
  - THD & noise optimization
  - Power-aware circuit design
  - Frequency response tuning
