title: Wideband Amplifier – Active Filter Design for 20Hz–20kHz Bandwidth
description:  A precision analog front-end designed using Sallen-Key active filters for wideband audio signals. This project focused on achieving low total harmonic distortion (THD < 0.5%), stable gain (100–500x), and a passband between 20 Hz and 20 kHz using LTspice simulation and prototyping techniques.

  - LTSPICE Simulation & Frequency Analysis
  - Analog Filter Design (HPF/LPF)
  - THD & Noise Optimization
  - Breadboard Prototyping & Oscilloscope Validation
  - Op-Amp Selection & Power Budgeting
  - Multi-stage Amplifier Design
